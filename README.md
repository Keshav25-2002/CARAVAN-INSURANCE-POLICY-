# CARAVAN-INSURANCE-POLICY-

To predict whether a customer is interested in a caravan insurance policy from other data about the customer.

Information about customers consists of 86 variables and includes product usage data and socio-demographic data derived from zip area codes. 

The data was supplied by the Dutch data mining company Sentient Machine Research and is based on a real-world business problem. 

The training set contains over 5000 descriptions of customers, including the information on whether or not they have a caravan insurance policy. 

The underlying problem is to find the subset of customers with a probability of having a caravan insurance policy above some boundary probability.

The known policyholders can then be removed and the rest receives a mailing. 

The boundary depends on the costs and benefits such as the costs of mailing and the benefits of selling insurance policies. 

To approximate this problem, we want you to find the set of 800 customers in the test set that contains the most caravan policy, owners.
